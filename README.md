# Estimating likelihood of high blood pressure based on BMI and Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)

Welcome to the repository containing the code and the output produced for the GEOG3140 Advanced Population and Health Geographies module. 

The aim of this quantitative analysis is to determine which measure of obesity (BMI vs WHR) is better at predicting the risk of having high blood pressure using Health Survey England 2019 data.

The results of this can be found in the forest plot output **ForestPlot.png** which shows the odds ratios for both BMI and WHR.

Enjoy looking through this repo! :)
